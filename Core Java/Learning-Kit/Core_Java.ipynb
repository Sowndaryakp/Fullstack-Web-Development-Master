        "# **What is JVM(Java Virtual Machine)?**\n",
        "It is a virtual machine that enables Java **bytecode** to be executed on a variety of platforms, providing the \"write once, run anywhere\" capability. The JVM interprets compiled Java bytecode and translates it into machine code that can be executed by the underlying hardware.\n",
        "\n",
        "# **History of Java.**\n",
        "Java was developed by James Gosling and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. It was officially released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, becoming the owner of Java.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The latest version of Java is **Java 21** or **JDK 21** released on September, 19th 2023.\n",
        "* Java is difficult but java is most **readable** language you can read the java code line by line.\n",
        "* IDE(**Integrated Development Environment**), is a software application aiding developers with tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers for software creation. It includes features such as version control and project management for a streamlined development experience.\n",

        "\n",
        "# **WORA(Write once run anywhere)**\n",
        "Java's WORA principle allows developers to write code that can run on any platform. It supports multithreading, enabling concurrent execution for efficient parallel processing. The Collection API simplifies data manipulation with a rich set of data structures. Java's robust exception handling enhances code reliability by effectively managing runtime errors.\n",
        "1.**Writing Code**: Developers write Java code using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.**Compilation**: The Java compiler (part of the JDK - Java Development Kit) translates the human-readable Java code into bytecode. Bytecode is an intermediate, platform-independent representation of the code.\n",

        "\n",
        "4.**Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: The JVM is responsible for running Java bytecode. It interprets the bytecode or, in some cases, Just-In-Time (JIT) compiles it into native machine code for the specific platform. This enables Java's \"Write Once, Run Anywhere\" capability.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.**Execution**: The JVM executes the bytecode, interacting with the underlying operating system and hardware to produce the desired output. The Java runtime environment (JRE) provides the necessary libraries and resources during execution.\n",
